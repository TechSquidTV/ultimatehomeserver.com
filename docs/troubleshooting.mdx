# Troubleshooting

## Verify services

Once the deployment or upgrade is complete, there are a number of ways to verify that the services are running correctly.

### Verify the Helm deployment

List the current helm deployments and verify that the `<your domain>` deployment is listed.

```bash
helm ls
```

### Verify the Kubernetes pods

List the current pods and verify that all pods are in the `Running` state.

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

## View logs

To view the logs for a specific service, you can use the `kubectl logs` command.

```bash
kubectl logs <pod name>
```

## 502 Bad Gateway

If you get a 502 Bad Gateway error when trying to access the application, it is likely that the application is still starting up but otherwise inaccessable.
Ensure first that the pod for the affected service is running and shows `1/1` under the `READY` column.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -A

NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
plex-xwz-123                         1/1     Running   0             5m
```

If you see `0/1` under the `READY` column, refer to the `STATUS` column to determine the cause of the failure.

If there is an issue you will likely see `CrashLoopBackOff` under the `STATUS` column. This indicates that the pod is crashing and restarting repeatedly, which is likely due to a configuration issue. To view the logs for the pod, use the `kubectl logs <pod name>` command.

If the `STATUS` reads `READY` and there is nothing in the container logs to indicate an issue, there is likely nothing wrong with the container itself. More likely, there is a misconfiguration between the container and the `nginx` config. Check to ensure the `port` defined for the service is correct. You may also want to check `files/nginx` to view the `nginx` configs.
