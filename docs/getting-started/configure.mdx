# Configure Services

UHS offers a large suite of services which are disabled by default. Via a _helm_ `values.yaml` file, you can enable and customize the services you want to use.

_See the [Services](/docs/category/services) section for more information on each service._

## UHS CLI

The `uhs` CLI can help you generate configuration files for UltimateHomeServer.

### Install

#### Binary

Utilize the install script to download the latest release for your platform.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechSquidTV/uhs-cli/main/install.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

```bash
./install.sh
```

#### Go

Alternatively, if your system has Go installed, you can install the CLI via the following command.

```bash
go install github.com/uhs-cli/uhs@latest
```

### Usage

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/T0Cz23OthKROiZi0FV2v5wfe2.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/T0Cz23OthKROiZi0FV2v5wfe2)

UltimateHomeServer is distributed as helm charts which can be customized via a `values.yaml` file. The `uhs` CLI can help you generate this file.

#### Generate Default Config

First generate the `default` configuration file. This file will serve as a template for all of the available services. We will next override this file with our own customizations.

```bash
uhs default -o values.yaml
```

#### Customize Services

To enable and customize the desired services, begin the configuration wizard by running the following command.

```bash
uhs configure -o secrets.yaml
```

This command will begin by prompting you to select the services you wish to enable. If you wish, you can also pass services as arguments to the command.

```bash
uhs configure nginx plex radarr sonarr -o secrets.yaml
```

These files will be placed in the same directory as the UltimateHomeServer repository at the root level, next to the `Chart.yaml` file.

## Prep the system

Once you have created your configuration files you will have multiple services similar to:

```yaml
    kavita:
        enabled: false
        replicaCount: 1
        image:
            repository: kizaing/kavita
            tag: latest
            pullPolicy: Always
        ports:
            http: 5000
        config: /opt/kavita/config
        library: /opt/kavita/library
```

Notice here we reference two paths `config` and `library`. These paths need to be created on the host system if they do no already exist and should be writable.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/kavita/config /opt/kavita/library
chmod -R 666 /opt/kavita/config /opt/kavita/library
```
