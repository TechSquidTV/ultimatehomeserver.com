# Deployment

When you have have configured your services and SSL certificates, you can deploy your server and begin accessing your services.

## Create Deployment

As [helm](https://helm.sh/) is used to deploy the server, you must first create a helm deployment.
This is a one time step, and is used to group all of your services together. You could run even more services outside of your UltimateHomeServer deployment in a separate deployment.

From within the root of your UHS directory (_usually `/opt/<your domain>`)_ run the following command to create your deployment:

```bash
./bin/deploy.sh <your domain>
```

`<your domain>` will be the name of your deployment, and will be used to identify it in the future.

## Deploy Services

With the deployment created, you can now deploy your services to it. Make sure you have both a `services.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` file in your UHS directory.

See [Configure](/docs/getting-started/configure) for more information on how to create and customize your configuration files.

When you are ready to deploy your services, run the following command:

```bash
./bin/upgrade.sh <your domain>
```

## Access Services

You should now be able to access your services _locally_ at their respective subdomains. For example, if you have configured [Homepage](/docs/services/Dashboard/homepage), you should be able to access it at `https://homepage.<your domain>.com`.

You can verify all of the URLS for your services by checking the `nginx` configuration in `files/nginx.conf`.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your UltimateHomeServer! ðŸŽ‰
