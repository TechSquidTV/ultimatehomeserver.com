Playwright is an open source Node library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

Using [browserless.io](https://www.browserless.io/), you can access a Playwright in a playground environment via the web and automate browser scraping with TypeScript all from the browser.
