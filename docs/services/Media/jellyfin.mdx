Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.
There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.
