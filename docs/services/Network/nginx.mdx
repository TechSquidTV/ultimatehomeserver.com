# Nginx

- [Website](https://nginx.org/)
- [Docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

Nginx is used as the [reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) for the `UHS`, this is what makes our services addressible via subdomains in the browser and enables SSL. This servive is _required_ for `UHS` to function.

## Configuration

See the [Nginx Configuration](/docs/nginx/configuration) page for more information on how to configure Nginx.

## More Information

In `UHS`, the Nginx configuration file is stored in `files/nginx.conf` and contains [helm templating](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/#the-chart-template-developer-s-guide). Each service has an entry in the Nginx config that that will be conditionally loaded based on the values passed in the `secrets.yaml` file.

An example of an Nginx config entry for the `UHS` service is below:

```nginx
{{- if .Values.services.homepage.enabled }}
  server {
    server_name homepage.{{ .Values.services.nginx.domain }};
    include ssl.conf;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://homepage:{{ .Values.services.homepage.ports.http }};
      include nginx_proxy_headers.conf;
    }
  }
{{- end }}
```

The line `server_name` also dictates the subdomain that will be used for the service. You can change it here if you wish.
